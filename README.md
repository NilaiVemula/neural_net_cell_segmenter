# Neural Net Cell Segmenter
Goal: develop a tool using machine learning to segment images of packed epithelial cell layers (for future use in pycellfit)

Project started in May 2020 by Nilai Vemula

## Development:
- Status: Planning and Brainstorming

## To-do List:
- [ ] Background Research
- [ ] Make a FCN or other type of neural network in TensorFlow
- [ ] Write scripts to pre-process and post-process images
- [ ] Create a training set of images from the ECAD dataset (provided by James White)
- [ ] Train neural network
- [ ] Evaluate accuracy of model and continue training
- [ ] Collect code as a package
